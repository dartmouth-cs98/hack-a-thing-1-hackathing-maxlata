## What I Made
I made a Chrome extension to interface with Firebase.

## Why?
So my boyfriend loves to show me YouTube videos, and he presents me with a long list of links with his own descriptions on his computer because he wants to surprise me with the content. Dom is not exactly what I'd call an early adopter; we have a Chromecast, and he refuses to use it in favor of his laptop (despite the fact that he always gets on the elderly for not adapting to new technology). I created the extension to save the links with a little description for me, and I intend to implement an Android app to pull this data to my phone, so I can cast it to our TV. 

## What Did I Learn?
I have never done any web development, and a whole website seemed like a lot to bite off, so I decided to do a Chrome extension to wet my feet in the area of HTML, CSS and Javascript. And let me tell you that's it's freaking HARD! I understand now why the woman at my internship in charge of the website liked to "affectionately" call CSS "Crap, Shit, Shit!". But I think I did learn a lot about the adding of scripts to different places as I leveraged two APIs, one for Firebase and one for an emoji picker I found online. I had to spend a lot of hours just understanding how the different files interacted with each other and what that meant, and I had to spend way too long figuring out a bug in which I realized I needed to list the scripts I was including in a different order. 

## Would I Do it Again?
Of course! I was originally going to do this in React, but I decided I should learn vanilla web dev first. I'd definitely go back and do this with React one day!
